When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to work with several computers or share your code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might be doing some stuff in local with hardcoded passwords or stuff 
    that you dont want to go public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is when in a repository you add a new commit that is not reachable 
    from any other branch and you put it a name. Its useful to have branches 
    for each developpement path you are taking, as well as a production one.

    A Clone is when you take a repository and make a full hard copy of it with 
    all its commit history in another machine / directory.

    A Fork is when you make a Clone from a Github repository into another 
    GitHub repository. Is usefull when you want to work in the repository of 
    someone and give him credit.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can merge it localy to apply the changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You would have to share the code in a remote file systemand you will have 
    to talk and look over everything for very single change

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
